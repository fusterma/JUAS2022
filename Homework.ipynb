    "    - We have only normal conducting magnets at our disposal with max. field strengths:\n",
    "        - For dipole magnets: Bmax ≤ 2 T and ld ≤ 5 m.\n",
    "        - For quadrupole magnets: dBy/dx|max ≤ 25 T/m & and lq≤1.5 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Consider a FODO μ=90° and with the help of the thin lense approximation parametric plots from Tutorial 1 set the strength of quadrupoles such that the βmax is 120 m in both planes. (HINT: use both, Figure 1 and Figure 2, to define the lenght of the FODO cell and the strength for a fixed quadrupole lenght of your choice).\n",

    "    - Consider 4 dipoles per FODO cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The circumference of the ring has to be 1000 m accounting for the FODO cells and about a ~30% margin for other insertions (pick a nice round number). (HINT: This information together with the length of the FODO cell allows you to fix the number of FODO cells that fits into your ring and hence the required angle of the bending magnets). \n",
